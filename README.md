# Kapil Saklani - Portfolio

A modern, responsive portfolio website built with HTML5, Bootstrap 5, and custom CSS.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Main entry point.
- `css/style.css`: Custom styles and theme variables.
- `js/script.js`: Interactive scripts.
- `assets/`: Images and static assets.

## How to Run

Since this is a static website, you can view it by simply opening `index.html` in your browser.

 For the best experience, use a local development server:

```bash
# Using Python
python3 -m http.server 8080

# Using Node.js http-server
npx http-server .
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8080`.
